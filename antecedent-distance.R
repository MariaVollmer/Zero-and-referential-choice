# This script computes the antecedent distance of referents 
# which is a variable in the computation of the decision trees.

# Nils Schiborr (University of Bamberg) has kindly shared this script with me, 
# which I have slightly adapted.
# Any remaining errors are my own. 

# all rows without referents (i.e. without RefIND glosses) 
# get \code{NA_integer_} in the
# distance columns.
